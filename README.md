# Custom-Planner
## ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
  A mobile-first day planner web application that allows a user to create an account, select a day from the calendar and create a to-do list. Edit, erase, or complete created to-do items. Each uncompleted to-do item rolls over to the next day. To-do lists refresh monthly. 
  
  This is an early stage of a project I have dreamed about. Unable to find a planner app that suits my preference, I am working on creating a customizable planner.
  
  We created a MERN Stack application which includes using a MongoDB database, Express to interact with the DOM through the server, the front end framework React, and Node on the backend.
  
  We used many node modules to make the development easier. To give an idea what technolgies we used, here are some of the important ones: 
  * apollo/client,
  * fortawesome,
  * bootstrap,
  * jwt-decode,
  * react,
  * react-bootstrap,
  * react-calendar,
  * dotenv,
  * bcrypt,
  * express,
  * jsonwebtoken,
  * mongoose,
  * graphql
  
  The application is hosted on a heroku server but can be ran locally if downloaded.
